    "### Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving Data Science problems often starts by defining a metric with which to evaluate solutions were you able to find some. This metric is called a cost function. Data Science then backtracks and tries to find a process / algorithm to find solutions that can optimize for that cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose you are asked to cluster three points A, B, C into two non-empty clusters. If someone gave you the solution `{A, B}, {C}`, how would you evaluate that this is a good solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that because the clusters need to be non-empty and all points must be assigned to a cluster, it must be that two of the three points will be together in one cluster and the third will be alone in the other cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above solution, if A and B are closer than A and C, and B and C, then this is a good solution. The smaller the distance between the two points in the same cluster (here A and B), the better the solution. So we can define our cost function to be that distance (between A and B here)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm / process would involve clustering together the two closest points and put the third in its own cluster. This process optimizes for that cost function because no other pair of points could have a lower distance (although it could equal it)."
